title: "Homebrew Launcher (Installer)"
---

{% include toc title="目录内容" %}

### 重要事项

The Homebrew Launcher is currently "installed" to your device through a browser exploit. 

After the initial installation process is completed, a secondary exploit must then be run which will allow you to access the Homebrew Launcher through the Album application *until your device is rebooted*. 

After a reboot, you will have to re-run this secondary exploit in order to re-enable Homebrew Launcher access on your device. Additionally, note that this secondary exploit will also prevent you from playing retail games for as long as it remains active (*until your device is rebooted*).
 
If you are familiar with iOS device "jailbreaking", this idea could be considered analagous to a "semi-untethered jailbreak".

Note that the current homebrew exploit has the side-effect of corrupting your device's Mii Database upon initial installation. While this effect is harmless, it will result in the loss of any user-created Miis.

1. 进入到 `Internet` -> `Internet Settings`
1. 选择当前网络
1. Select "Connect to this Network"

1. Launch the Album application
1. If the exploit was successful, the Homebrew Launcher will launch

#### Section V - Alternative Browser Applets (Optional)

As you must re-run the "Run" section of the exploit after each reboot, it would be ideal if there was a more convenient way of launching the browser than the connection test.

Fortunately, there are actually [multiple](http://switchbrew.org/index.php?title=Internet_Browser#Browser_Applets) browser applets on the Switch, and any of them can be used to trigger the browser exploit.

Two convenient methods for launching a browser are listed below:

##### eShop Sign In Prompt

To use this method, create a second account on your device. Do not connect it to a Nintendo Account.

1. Launch Nintendo eShop
1. Select the second account
1. Select "Sign In and link"
1. The browser applet will launch

##### Game Update Prompt

To use this method, you must have at least one game on your home screen.

Note that, if you were not connected to the correct DNS servers, this method would *update* your device. It is dangerous!
{: .notice--danger}

1. Press (+) with any game highlighted
1. In the "Software Update" tab, select "Via the Internet"
1. The browser applet will launch

Note that, currently, homebrew development is in a very early state with a very limited number of applications.

You can find available applications on [switchbrew](http://switchbrew.org/index.php?title=Homebrew_Applications), [/r/SwitchHacks on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchHacks/), or [Switch Homebrew on GBAtemp](https://gbatemp.net/forums/285/).

To install homebrew applications, simply copy the homebrew `.nro` file to the `/switch/` folder on your SD card.

You can now launch the Homebrew Launcher by launching the Album application from your device's home menu (*until your device is rebooted*).
{: .notice--success}

You will now be unable to launch retail cartridge or eShop games (*until your device is rebooted*).
{: .notice--warning}

You will need to re-run the "Run" step of the exploit (using any browser applet) after each reboot in order to re-enable Homebrew Launcher access on your device.
