### Required Reading

All game cards contain a copy of the required firmware version to play it, allowing anyone on a lower version to update to that version and play the game (even without an internet connection).

We can take advantage of this by using a game containing a specific version in order to install a more recent firmware version (3.0.0) without updating all the way to the latest available. 

Before performing the game card update, we block online updates by using airplane mode and enter Recovery / Maintenance Mode to delete any update data which may have already been downloaded.

### What you need

* An original revision game card of [Pokkén Tournament DX](https://amzn.to/2F9nsF3)
  + Original revisions of this game card contain 3.0.0; they have a green printed circuit board and a serial ending in **000** (see image below)
  + Newer revisions of this game card contain 3.0.1; they have a black printed circuit board and a serial ending in **001** (*avoid using these to update!*)
